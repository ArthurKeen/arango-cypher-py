"""Complete a saved query's bind variables and run it read-only under caps.

Saved values are used as stored. Canvas actions are the exception: they run on
the nodes a user selected (``@nodes``), which a saved query cannot carry, so
start vertices are sampled from the graph — first from collections the action's
own name and description point at ("From a selected IAM role/user" →
``aws_iam_role``, ``aws_iam_user``), then from the rest, taking only vertices
that have edges in the graph — and the first start that returns rows is kept.

Every run is bounded: :data:`MAX_RUNTIME_S` server-side, and at most
:data:`ROW_CAP` rows read. A query that returns more cannot be compared
reliably (the Cypher side might return a different first ``ROW_CAP`` rows), so
it is rejected as too large rather than compared on a prefix.
